# Mongoose API Workshop - Exercise 2 - Implement Mongoose

## Replace dummy data by mongoose database calls

* Setup a Mongoose connection
    * do this BEFORE all your routes
        * do NOT setup the mongoose connection WITHIN a route!
    * do not use any mongoose connection events

* Setup schema and model for a flat
    * A flat document should be defined like this:
        * address_full: String (Street Nr, Zipcode, City, Country)
        * district: String,
        * area_sqm: Number,
        * rooms: Number,
        * rent: Number,
        * landlord: String
    * Make the field address required
    * Give the field rooms a default value 1

* Adapt routes - Replace prototype dummy data by real database implementation
    * replace dummy data in routes with Mongoose CRUD
    * use a then() handler after each mongoose operation
        * use res.send() within your then() handler to send data back to the browser
    * use a catch(err) handler after each mongoose operation
        => call the next() function and pass the received error into it 

* Test your routes
    * Create three flats using your POST fetch call
    * Retrieve all flats using your GET fetch call
    * And also test retrieving a single flat, updating and deleting a flat
